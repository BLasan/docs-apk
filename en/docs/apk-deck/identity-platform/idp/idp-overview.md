# IdPs

Identity Providers, which are also referred to as IdPs, store and manage digital identities. By default, APK supports an inbuilt non-production identity provider/token service, which is only meant for testing purposes. APK also supports third party IdPs, namely Asgardeo and Auth0.

WSO2 APK integrates with IdPs to obtain a token to use the System APIs and also to login to the portal.
